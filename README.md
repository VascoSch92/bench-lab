# Bench Lab (WIP)

---

This is a very early stage of the project. 

Still a lot to clean and fix.

The goal is to develop a unified framework for evaluating LLMs, agents, and RAG systems across well-known and custom 
benchmarks, while providing users with statistical tools to understand and improve their systems.
